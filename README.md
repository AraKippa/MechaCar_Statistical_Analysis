## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Both vehicle length and ground clearance provided a significant amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
Our slope of the linear model is considered to be close to zero. Our estimated slope is -1.040e+02 with a Std Error of  1.585e+01. The p-value of 5.08e-08, well short of our 0.05 statistical parameters. With a slope to zero it calls into question the validity of of variance. The closer to zero our slope the less significance our independent variable if m=0 then m(x) = 0. Negating any significant relationship between x and y.
Per our multiple R squared value of 0.7149 and a p-value of 5.35e-11 this linear model appears to predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. However, there are only two variables which have significant variance in our data set. Indicating over half our independent variables have no affect on mpg.  This makes this model look like a poor predictor for MechaCar prototypes.
